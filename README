CS457 Assignment 1 Solution
---------------------------

IMPORTANT: 
The default server port is 5000. However, if many students execute the server on 
the same CSD machine this will be a conflict. If you run your server on CSD's 
machines, change the port with your AM, as stated in the exercise description.
---------------------------

Sample Execution:

tty1 $ ./server

tty2 $ ./client -i 127.0.0.1 -p 5000 -m hello_from_cs457
